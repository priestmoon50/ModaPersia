              Verified by Visa (VbV) is an online security service that helps protect Visa cardholders when making purchases over the internet. This service provides an additional layer of security by requiring the cardholder to enter a password or code during the checkout process. This ensures that the transaction is being carried out by the authorized cardholder and not someone else.
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
              When you use a Visa card that is enrolled in the Verified by Visa program, you may be prompted to enter your password or one-time code before your transaction is processed. This verification process reduces the risk of fraud and unauthorized transactions. If you have not yet registered your Visa card for this service, you can do so through your bankâ€™s website.

              MasterCard SecureCode is a service offered by MasterCard that enhances the security of online transactions. It works by requiring cardholders to enter a private code during online purchases. This code is known only to the cardholder and their bank, adding an extra layer of protection against unauthorized use of the card.
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
              When you make a purchase online with a MasterCard that is enrolled in the SecureCode program, you will be prompted to enter your SecureCode before the transaction is approved. This helps ensure that even if someone else has your card number, they wonâ€™t be able to use it for online purchases without knowing the SecureCode. You can enroll your MasterCard in the SecureCode program through your bank.
